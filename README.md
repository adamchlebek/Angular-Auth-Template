> This project is to help easily setup your Authentication Application. I have created a Frontend template in Angular 9 that you are able to use, or you can use just the server. Reference the Readme for the respective projects to get it setup!

## Features

- Server Applcation uses PassportJS as well as JWT.
- You can easily add new Passport Strategies (Adding new strategies soon)

## Getting Started

- You will need to run the `npm i` script inside of the root folder, as well as the server folder. 
- You will also need to create a `.env` file inside your server folder. It should look like this:
```
secret = INSERT_SECRET_HERE
```

## Development

- In order to run the project locally, you will need to open two seperate command line windows. In one window, in the root folder, run `ng serve` to start the front end. You will also need to open up the server folder in your command line and run `npm run dev` in order to get the server up.
